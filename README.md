## About

_CDEye_ is a visualization toolkit for [CDI][]. It consists of:
+ A CDI [portable extension][] that provides access to the CDI deployment metadata,
+ A series of RESTful Web Services packaged as a WAR portable to any [JAX-RS][] compliant runtime that expose these metadata,
+ An HTML5 front-end that uses [cola.js][] and [D3.js][] to layout and display the dependency injection graph along with the [bean archives][] structure.
